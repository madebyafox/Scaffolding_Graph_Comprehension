Experimental Stimuli Codebase for 2YP - Scaffolding Unconventional Graphs - Study 3: Eye Tracking

SAMPLE URL FOR HEROKUAPP:

Notes
----------

Due to the constraints of the eye tracking software (Mangold Vision), the experimental codebase for Study 3 is substantially different in structure than study 2 (experiment)
:: owing to the inability to send data from one "item" in an subject run to another, each condition will be contained in a separate codebase with different url
:: owing to the inability to send data """ each question in the test battery will be accessed via a unique url.
:: VERY IMPORTANTLY, this has implications for the (lack) of session-level data that can be stored in each database record
::: Each page (item level question) will be stored in the database as an individual record WITHOUT subject-level information. This relies on the analyst to consolidate records based on the order and timestamps of entry into the database


Structure
-----------
Condition [0-3] and question [0-14] are set in the querystring


Installation & Notes
------------------
https://github.com/Tuuleh/jsPsychBackendStart as reference
0, Requires node.js
1. After download of files from github, run [ npm update ] to install node_modules
2. Check app.js file for proper configuration of local vs. hosted db information and server connections
3. Run local Mongodb    [ mongod in terminal ]
4. Start application [node app.js]
5. Navigate to localhost:3000
6. View database by running viewer (like RoboMongo)


Technical Notes
------------------
- jsPsych http://docs.jspsych.org/ library for structuring experiment
- d3 http://d3js.org/ for data visualization stimuli
- node.js
- express node runtime framework
- ejs template engine
- nodemon for reload
- Body-parser is middleware for Node.js that allows you to parse key-value data
- mongoose is a MongoDB driver for the Express framework
> thanks to https://github.com/Tuuleh/jsPsychBackendStart for boilerplate Mongo-Express-Node stack for db connectivity

Dev Notes
-------------------
> configure for local dev (check app.js file and un-comment local dev)
> for heroku deploy... setup new database on mlab
> setup new heroku application
> see https://github.com/Tuuleh/jsPsychBackendStart for reference
> see https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git for reference
> set mongo path in heroku with
heroku config:set CONNECTION = [mongolabs uri]

Welcome to the "Scaffolding Comprehension for Unconventional Graphs" project. 
(Amy Rae Fox, UCSD Cognitive Science, Second Year Project)

_We are investigating the nature of the graph schema, and how learners come to make sense of statistical graphics._

We make use of the Triangular Model of Interval Relations, an unconventional representation of time intervals.

## Structure
- docs/ public website hosted by GitHub pages
- GraphClient --> sample D3 code for rendering the TM graph
- STUDY_1 --> observational study with the TM Model
- STUDY_2 --> experimental study comparing explicit scaffolds (mixed: 5(scaffold [between]) X 2(graph [within]))
- VIZ --> WIP interactive visualization code 
- note that docs/ folder contains polished analyses, while the STUDY_1 and STUDY_2 folders contain interim and exploratory analyes as well (including some SPSS files)
- prior subdirectories with (pilot) data for Study 3 and Study 5 (interaction) removed and backed up in main SGC-X repository

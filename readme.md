Welcome to the "Scaffolding Comprehension for Unconventional Graphs" project.
We are investigating the nature of the graph schema, and how learners come to make sense of statistical graphics.

We make use of the Triangular Model of Interval Relations, an unconventional representation of time intervals.

GraphClient --> sample D3 code for rendering the TM graph
STUDY_1 --> observational study with the TM Model
STUDY_2 --> experimental study comparing explicit scaffolds (mixed: 5(scaffold [between]) X 2(graph [within]))
STUDY_3 --> experimental study comparing explicit scaffolds and impasse problem structure (between: 4(scaffold) X 2 (impasse))
STUDY_3_EYE --> experimental version of STUDY_3 re-architected for use with eye tracking application

**How do you make sense of a graph that you have never seen before?**   
As powerful as graphics may be in their communicative efficiency, they needn’t be immediately easy to understand. In fact, there are often real tradeoffs between a representation’s discoverability and efficiency. Peebles & Cheng (2003) demonstrated that even for informationally equivalent graphs, the computational efficiency (operationalized in terms of the number of steps to retrieve information) of a less conventional representation may outweigh its ease of use to the untrained reader.  It is this fact that underlies much modern research in Information Visualization: developing sophisticated information interfaces for highly skilled workers performing complex and specialized tasks.  Sometimes this work results in novel, unconventional representations that are computationally suited to a particular set of data and analytical task, but that present a graph-reading challenge to the lay reader.  Most work in remediating errors in graph comprehension has focused on “second order” readings: characterizing the trend or relationships between data points in a graph. In the case of time interval graphs this would involve generalizations like, “most events occur late in the day”, or “longer events start earlier in the day”. We tend to accept a priori that well-designed graphs readily afford first-order readings: operations for extracting data from the graph. In fact, it is the seeming effortlessness of these readings that make graphs so desirable as external representations. In this project, we use a simple but unconventional graph - The Triangular Model (TM) of Interval Relations (Qiang et. al. 2014)  to explore how individuals make use of prior knowledge when reading unconventional graphs.  


In <a href="Study1.html">**Study 1**</a> we observe learner's solving problems with the TM graph, and challenge them to design instructional aids.    
In <a href="Study2.html">**Study 2**</a> we design four scaffolding techniques and test their efficacy with both LM and TM graphs.    
In <a href="Study3.html">**Study 3**</a> we compare the effectiveness of explicit and implicit (impasse problems) for the TM graph.

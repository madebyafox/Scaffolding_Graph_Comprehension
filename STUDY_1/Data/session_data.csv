She tends to take longer answering questions because she goes through all the points and eliminates most answers before deciding on the final answer. She doesn't get through all the questions (perhaps because she's doing it alone). Last question she attempts to answer (Question 15, starts + finishes relation) she recognizes that based on her interpretation of the graph, there is no answer and that she may be interpreting the graph incorrectly."D6,AXIS,0,5,11,24:52:00,LM,HL,"They begin to clearly use the linear interpretation by Question 4 (midpoint relation). There were multiple questions (Question 5, start + overlap relation; Question 7, before + overlap relation); Question 13, during relation; Question 15, starts + finishes relation) where they were confused about what the question was asking or whether there was even an apprpriate answer at all. They would revist these questions after looking to future questions, pulling information from the context of other problems. Participants draw a lot of guiding lines to help them find specific times and durations, but erases them as they go through the problems. Through the entire study, they give no indication of acknowledging the triangular grid lines, and they do not use the intersections of the triangle grid to help guide to find the x-axis intercept that is perpendicular to the data point."D2,AXIS,1,7,8,17:42:00,LM,ARF,This group drew a lot on the graph and used different colors to map out a linear interpretation. Said the grid lines were there for continuoulsy checking the points on the graph.D3,AXIS,1,9,6,16:23:00,LM,ARF,These participants were pretty silent for the most part. They would mumble the questions and agree upon the answers but they did not want to think out loud too much.D5,AXIS,1,10,6,20:00:00,LM,HL,"Participants use the linear model interpretation immediately. They have an initial set-up period where they communicate what kind of information the graph is giving them and then jump into the questions. They get stuck on Question 4 (midpoint relation) because it took more time to figure out correct answers (based on their interpretation). They make a comment when doing Question 12 (finishes relation) that it might have been easier if they had drawn out all the duration lines for each point. They skip Question 13 (during relation) because they wrote the answer to Question 12 in the Question 13 box; they immediately go back to do Question 13 after answering Question 14. They get stuck on Question 15 because their interpretation of the graph doesn't match up wtih the question, eventually settling on the answer of ""none"""D9,AXIS,1,9,6,21:12:00,LM,KC,The pair go straight to the questions at the beginning of the video. Their initial interpretation of the graph is linear when they try to answer the first question. The pair then approach the rest of the questions the same with the same interpretation. They first encounter significant confusion while trying to solve problem four but then still use linear interpretation. The pair answer the questions in the order presented on the paper.S4,AXIS,2,7,7,33:59:00,LM,HL,"Participant starts out using the linear interpretation of the graph. Once she hits Question 3 (Duration relation), she draws an entirely new graph using time of day on both x and y axes on a separate sheet of paper. She draws each data point information onto her graph. She then uses her newly drawn graph to help answer the questions, adding additional information to help her (e.g. midpoints of data points). She circles/marks up the question sheet to help her identify important information. Starting wtih question 6, she begins to use/consult the provided triangular interval graph again by finding relevant information that she can then translate back onto her graph, where she find the appropriate answers."S3,LONGMIRE,2,10,6,20:00:00,LM,ARF,This person was on their ownS1,LONGMIRE,5,3,10,18:18:00,neither,KC,"Subject starts with reading the description of the task before getting to the questions. She then starts to answer the question in the order that is presented on the paper. Throughout the task she uses a triangular interpretation, but instead of perceiving the left side of the triangle as start time and right as end, she interprets the left as end time and right as start time. The issue in the interpretation confuses the subject the most in problem eleven, and the time ends when she tries to work on the 12th problem."D1,LONGMIRE,5,13,0,18:58:00,LM,EB,"Participants start out using linear perception of graph. They draw horizontal lines to easily depict the durations of each point. The left particpant used the pen a lot as a 'strategy' to determine the answers. The couple did not talk out loud too much but rather would use the pen to look at and then agree by verbaly saying the points. They could not figure out the 15th question, so skipped it and came back and ultimately gave up."D4,LONGMIRE,6,10,4,20:27:00,LM,HL,"They committed to the Linear Model interpretation right off the bat and stuck with it, even when there were questions that gave conflicting/slightly off answers. Had 2 questions where they took a bit longer to figure out: Question 2, end relation because they took longer to find all the answers & Question 15, starts+finishes relation because they interpreted the word ""task"" as a literal thing to do vs the task done in the room reservation. The first time they drew on graph was for Question 12, finishes relation."S5,LONGMIRE,10,3,6,19:08:00,TM,ARF,D7,LONGMIRE,13,5,0,18:18:00,TM,KC,"The pair start with reading the problem description out loud to understand the task. Then the pair refers to the graph and talk about the meaning of the label and datapoints to make sense out of it before answering the question. Upon trying to answer the first question, they successfully come to full understanding of how the triangular model works, and they move on to answer the rest of the questions in the order presented on the paper."D8,AXIS,14,1,2,20:00:00,TM,KC,"The pair first attempt to start answering the questions without reading the general description, but they did go back to read the description about the senario eventually before they start the task. The pair came to full understanding of how the graph function when they try to answer the first question. Then they move onto the rest of the questions in the order presented on the paper. In general, question reading and interpreting is done silently and individually first before they discuss their thoughts and interpretation."

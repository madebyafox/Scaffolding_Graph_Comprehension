> ran descriptive statistics

For 24 norming participants, 9 completed the axis scenario, and 15 the longmire.
ANOVAS with total_time and total_score as DVs and scenario as IV failed to reveal significant differences
The minimum number of linear questions correct = 0, and the maximum is 14.
The shortest amount of time is 427152ms and the maximum is 1835381ms.

:: should re-run analyses with more participants (ie. experimental groups with linear first and control = no scaffold)

04.06.2017   PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENT DATA ANALYSIS
Goal: Determine whether to proceed with modifying the experimental design
> What would motivate that decision?
>IF the linear model task is serving as a scaffold for the triangle task, then we may have a ceiling and the effect
of the scaffolds may be outweighed.
> This would be the case if the data show that performance on the triangle (in the control condition) is significantly better on the REVERSE mode than the experiment
mode.


likely user TGAU4 in BRAVO that I disrupted and resulted in really long time, however she was not the longest in the trial so maybe it's ok

Which scenario was harder? axis or longmire?

STEP ONE: EXPORT DATA FROM DB SERVER TO LOCAL
//for each session, export the records into a json file for the session from the server
mongoexport -h ds161159.mlab.com:61159 -d 2ypdbh -c entries -u expadmin -p secondyear --out purple2.json
mongoexport -h [connectionstring] -d [dbname] -c [tablename] -u [username] -p [password] --out [filename]

STEP TWO: IMPORT DATA FROM FILE INTO LOCAL DB
> start local database (in any directory) run
mongod
> start mongodb compass
> import the previously exported file into the local DB for analysis
mongoimport -d LABS -c [SESSIONNAME] --file [filename.json]

STEP THREE: EXTRACT DATA FROM MONGODB
> start roboMongo
> access relevant data analysis script (ie. master_session.js)
> manually edit master_session.js to address the session data you wish to extract from the DB, then run
> convert final extracted records from .json to .csv using https://json-csv.com/

STEP FOUR: manually construct master spss / R data sets
> in each _participants.xls file created, manually split demographics fields into separate columns by ','delimiter
> create _min (or _m) translations for each time field (recorded in miliseconds)
> filter out exception cases that we don't want to process in R
> MUST EXCLUDE CONDITION 4 IN DELTA SESSION & BELOW (before interactive instructions were added)

MASTER DATA WRANGLING
In the all.xls, the raw tab contains all data
> the all tab contains all data with flags
> the wrangled tab contains final data set without removed rows, reorganized and with addition of time in minutes

all.participants
> remove 20 participants who were in condition 4 BEFORE the interactive condition instructions were added


DATABASE BACKUPS
mongodump --db LABS
exports the LABS database (running on default local) to bson files to /dump in current directory

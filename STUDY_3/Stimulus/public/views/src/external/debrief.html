    <p style="font-style:italic">Thank you very much for your participation! This debriefing will tell you more about the study, what you did, and why.

    <p> <b>What did you just do?</b>
      You have just used a series of pictures (charts, graphs and diagrams) accompanied by different types of instructions to
      answer a series of problem solving questions.  While you were using the pictures, we measured
      where you clicked, scrolled and pointed with the computer mouse.  We also measured the accuracy of your responses and
      the time it took to complete each question.</p>

    <p> <b>Why did we have you do it?</b>
      Researchers of learning and cognition have long been interested in how graphic displays of information can be used to communicate,
      solve problems, and generate insights. As powerful as graphics may be in their communicative efficiency, they're not always
      immediately intuitive to understand. In short, we know a great deal more about learning with representations than we do about
      the learning of representations. In this project we are building upon previous research on reading and graph comprehension
      to explore how readers make sense of unfamiliar representations. The instructions you saw for each type of graph are known
      as “scaffolding techniques”, and we will compare your performance with the scaffolding techniques you saw with the performance of other participants to determine which types of instructions are most effective in helping humans to make sense of unfamiliar graphs.
    </p>

    <p><b>What do we expect to find?</b>
      We expect that you will have found some of the graphics more difficult to use than others.  We also expect that with the assistance of the instructions, after solving several problems you will learn to use the difficult graphics so that you can answer the questions even more quickly than without.
      If you would like to receive a copy of the results of the study, or have any further questions, please contact the researchers

    <p style="font-style:bold;">It is important that you do not discuss this experiment with other students who might participate after you.
      They must participate in the same way as you did, without any knowledge of what the experiment entails, or the reasoning behind it.</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">Thank you for your time! We hope you enjoyed participating in this study as much as we enjoyed designing it.</p>
